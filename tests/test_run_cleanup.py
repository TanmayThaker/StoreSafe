"""A run that dies must give its video handles back.

`cap` and `writer` used to be released at exactly two points in the frame loop:
the end of the video, and the cancel branch. Every other way out leaked both —
and the leak is not academic. The RuntimeError that started this investigation

    RuntimeError: Input type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) and weight type
                  (torch.FloatTensor) should be the same

is raised from the classifier INSIDE the loop, so each failed run left an open
VideoCapture and a VideoWriter still holding a lock on its AVI. Under Windows
that lock is what turns one bad run into "the next run's writer cannot open its
file".

These tests drive the real cleanup path with a stubbed pipeline: no clip, no
weights, no GPU, so they run anywhere.
