"""Two overlapping runs must not share one output file.

Run with:  python tests/test_video_io_paths.py

WHAT BROKE
----------
`create_writer()` and `reencode_to_mp4()` both used FIXED paths in the system
tempdir — `pops_demo_raw.avi` and `pops_demo_output.mp4`. Runs overlap in this
app: the case report is a separate Gradio event that can still be running when
the next Run Analysis starts, and a second app instance on the same machine
shares the same tempdir. Two runs then write one file, which fails two ways:

  PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it
  is being used by another process: '...\\pops_demo_raw.avi'

— observed while a second run was encoding — and, where it does not raise, the
quieter one: run B's MP4 is served as run A's result.

Each run now gets its own directory. The basenames are unchanged, so a
downloaded file is still `pops_demo_output.mp4`.

No GPU, no ffmpeg, no video decode — the encode itself is stubbed.

Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches the rest of the repo.
