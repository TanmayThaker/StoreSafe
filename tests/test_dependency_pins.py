"""requirements.txt must pin the packages that decide tracker behaviour.

Unpinned ultralytics/numpy/opencv is how the conda `all` env and
storesafe_env drifted onto different ultralytics releases and produced
materially different POPS output from the same video. The compat shim makes
those releases agree; pinning stops the drift recurring silently.

The structural assertions here fail the build. The installed-vs-pinned check is
reported rather than asserted: the conda env is shared with other projects and
is not obliged to match this repo's pins — but you should still see, in one
line, when the interpreter you are running does not.

Runs anywhere — reads a text file.
