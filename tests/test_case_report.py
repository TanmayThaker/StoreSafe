"""
Case-report builder tests — pure HTML generation, no GPU and no video decode.

Run with:  python tests/test_case_report.py

The Operations Highlights section carries the same trap the operational alerts
tab does: "no issues found" and "the rules never ran" are DIFFERENT answers,
and rendering the second as the first is a clean bill of health for a clip
nothing was ever checked on. Those three states are pinned below, because none
of them raises when it is wrong — the report just reads confidently and lies.

Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches tests/test_vlm_parse.py.
