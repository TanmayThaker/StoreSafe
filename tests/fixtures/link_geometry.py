"""Real person/cart box geometry from the 1764099569430 OUTSIDE clip.

Every box here was read out of that run's own tracking JSON, so the numbers are
what the pipeline actually saw — not a hand-drawn approximation of it. They exist
because the linker's association bug is a GEOMETRY bug, and a synthetic fixture
with tidy boxes cannot reproduce it: what breaks the linker is a scene with real
depth, where a person metres away from a cart still overlaps it in 2D.

WHY THESE SIX CASES
-------------------
Two of them are the mislinks that cost the clip its pushout (see
docs/missed_pushout_fix_plan.md):

  * P4 -> C1  a person in the extreme foreground, truncated by the bottom frame
              edge, whose feet land 151 px BELOW the cart's base. Linked anyway,
              at IoU 0.05, and it held the link from frame 68 to 109 — which is
              what kept C1's real handler from ever being considered.
  * P2 -> C3  the same error in the other direction: C3 is a cart in the far
              background, seen through the doorway, and P2 is 170 px in FRONT of
              its base. Linked at 2D distance 101 px.

Four of them are links that are CORRECT and must survive any gate added to fix
the two above. Three matter especially:

  * P2 -> C1 at frame 24 is the true handler with his lower body OCCLUDED BY THE
              BASKET he is leaning over, so his box ends 210 px above the cart's
              own base. A naive "feet must be near the cart's base" test rejects
              him — the very link the fix exists to enable. What separates him
              from P4 is not distance from the base but WHICH SIDE: his box ends
              INSIDE the cart's vertical extent, P4's ends far below it.
  * P4 -> C4 is the same P4, foreground, correctly owning the foreground cart.
              A gate that just distrusts foreground people breaks this.
  * P3 -> C3 is C3's real owner while C3 is still near the door.

Boxes are (x1, y1, x2, y2), exactly as the linker receives them.
