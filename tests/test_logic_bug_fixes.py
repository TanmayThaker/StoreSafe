"""
Regressions for eight logic defects found in the rule engine / POPS pipeline.

Run with:  python tests/test_logic_bug_fixes.py

Every one of these failed SILENTLY in production — no exception, no empty
output, just a wrong number or a missing alert that looked exactly like "the
model decided nothing happened". That is why they are pinned here.

The assertions deliberately go through the real entry points — evaluate_rules(),
compute_direction_label(), prune_event_log(), TrackingEngine._sanitize_timestamps()
— not through re-implementations of their internals. tests/test_grabrun_override.py
is the cautionary tale: it passes today while a later block in the same function
undoes what it pins, because it replayed the decision chain instead of calling it.

Deliberately stdlib + numpy, no pytest — matches the rest of the repo.
