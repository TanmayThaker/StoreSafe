"""
engine.highlights tests — the selection logic shared between the case
report's Operations Highlights section and the tracking JSON's
operational_highlights key.

The precedence test below is the one this module exists to pin: zone-
independent rules (abandoned cart, incoming empty) can produce findings while
rules_unavailable_reason is also set (no door/aisle zones drawn, so
blocked-door/static-cart didn't run). Checking emptiness of rule_findings
before checking the reason would let those findings leak into a "findings"
state when the correct answer is "did not run" — that bug would not raise, it
would just quietly disagree with what the HTML report says for the exact same
clip.

Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches tests/test_case_report.py.
