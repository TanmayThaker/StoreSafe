"""Abandonment must survive the link being released.

`abandoned` is the strongest term in compute_pops() — it floors an outbound
loaded cart at MERCH_REMOVED_FLOOR (75) and is the only route to PUSHOUT ALERT
below PUSHOUT_SCORE. It used to be readable ONLY while the cart was still linked,
which made it unavailable in exactly the state where the question matters: a cart
whose owner has gone. See docs/missed_pushout_fix_plan.md.

THE INVARIANT THAT MUST NOT BREAK
---------------------------------
classify_event() documents that `abandoned` is only ever True for a cart that was
LINKED first, so a cart which never had an owner — one sitting in a corral, say —
cannot reach PUSHOUT ALERT except on score alone. The fix widens WHEN the question
can be asked, not WHICH carts it can be asked about. A cart with no remembered
owner still answers False forever, and that is pinned below.

These are unit tests over the abandonment decision, expressed against the same
inputs the frame loop computes it from. They do not decode video — the end-to-end
behaviour on real pixels is pinned by tests/fixtures/golden/baseline_outside.json.
