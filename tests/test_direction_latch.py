"""
Direction-latch tests — pure logic, no GPU and no video decode.

Run with:  python tests/test_direction_latch.py

The fixture is real. It is the per-frame direction_label of Cart 1 from the
1763942209000_B8A44F1EDC34-medium-OUTSIDE clip, read out of that run's tracking
JSON, plus the frames on which `abandoned` was true. That run is a confirmed
pushout — a cart wheeled out of the door and left standing outside holding
unbagged merchandise — and the annotated video showed PUSHOUT ALERT on 15 of
416 frames (153-167, 0.79s at 19 fps) while the POPS table reported PUSHOUT
ALERT for the cart overall.

The cause was not the classifier and not abandonment. The cart parked at y~290
from frame 105, so by frame 169 the trailing DIRECTION_WINDOW_S=4.0s delta had
fallen to 17px, under DIRECTION_MIN_DY, and the heading read UNKNOWN for the
remaining 13 seconds. compute_pops() caps an abandoned loaded cart at 65 in the
UNKNOWN branch, so every one of those frames scored ABANDONED CART, while the
finaliser — which reads direction off the peak event, logged at frame 104 while
the cart was still rolling — scored the same cart 75 / PUSHOUT ALERT.

Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches the rest of the repo.
