"""Regressions for the two defects that made a finished run look like a hung
page. Both are invisible in code review and produce no error anywhere.

Run with:  python tests/test_progress_and_frontend.py

  1. PROGRESS LEAK. `gradio.helpers.Progress` keeps `self.iterables` on the
     instance and pops an entry only when the tracked iterator raises
     StopIteration. The frame loop breaks out early (CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT
     over-reports), so every run left one entry behind — and with
     `progress=gr.Progress()` as a DEFAULT ARGUMENT there was one instance for
     the whole process. Progress reports the entire list on every step, so run
     N drew N progress bars, N-1 of them frozen mid-run forever.

  2. OBSERVER AMPLIFICATION. static/app.js binds behaviour from a
     MutationObserver over the whole body subtree, and its callback walks the
     whole document. Uncoalesced, rendering a result set multiplies thousands
     of Svelte mutations by a full-document pass each, on the main thread.

Deliberately stdlib + gradio only, no pytest — matches the other suites.
