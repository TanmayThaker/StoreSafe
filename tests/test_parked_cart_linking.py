"""A cart that has never moved cannot be owned by someone walking past it.

The geometry is real: tests/fixtures/parked_cart_geometry.py holds the boxes from
the 1764200318790 INSIDE clip, where an empty cart parked inside the entrance was
given to a shopper entering the store on six frames of corner overlap at IoU
0.039-0.064, kept for the remaining 279 frames of the run, and then scored
ABANDONED CART (65) when she walked out of the doorway.

WHAT THIS PINS
--------------
1. "Parked" needs BOTH a small centroid sweep and LINK_STATIC_MIN_FRAMES of
   observation. Extent alone calls every newly appeared cart parked, including
   one a shopper is about to take out of the corral.
2. On a parked cart the co-movement exemption is granted only to a person at
   IoU >= LINK_STATIC_MIN_IOU. A parked cart can never fail the co-movement test
   on its own account, so at LINK_MIN_IOU that exemption was open to anyone whose
   box touched it.
3. A parked cart's confirmation bar is LINK_CONTESTED_FRAMES even with one
   candidate.
4. Neither gate applies to a cart that HAS moved — that is the golden OUTSIDE
   clip's own cart, which rolls in and comes to rest with its real handler
   working at it, and it is pinned end-to-end by
   tests/fixtures/golden/baseline_outside.json.
5. A link on a cart that has not moved since it was established is released when
   the owner is visible and no longer touching it, even though nobody is taking
   the cart over.
5b. The release reports the cart as DISOWNED — which is what tells the tracker to
   forget the remembered owner too — only when the link never amounted to
   possession, measured as its peak IoU against LINK_OWNED_PEAK_IOU. A link that
   DID reach possession is released without being disowned, so the owner stays on
   record and can still be scored as abandonment when they leave. The real
   geometry for that half is tests/fixtures/door_side_owner_geometry.py: the
   FF1763940475070 door-side cart, whose owner held it at IoU peak 0.363 for a
   hundred frames without ever pushing it.
6. A person who leaves the FRAME still keeps the link, parked cart or not. That
   is abandonment, and it is the invariant tests/test_abandonment_after_release.py
   exists to protect.
