"""
Static-latch tests — pure logic, no GPU and no video decode.

Run with:  python tests/test_static_latch.py

The fixture is real. It is the per-frame window displacement of Cart 21 and
Person 17 on 1764099569430_B8A44F3CB0B9-medium-OUTSIDE.mp4, frames 158-175,
read out of both runs of that clip: one under ultralytics 8.4.19 / conda, one
under 8.4.40 / venv, on the same machine against the same footage.

The two runs produced the same tracks and the same detections to within 0.005
px. They disagreed about one number: on frame 162 the cart's six-frame
displacement measured 5.001559 px in one and 4.999244 px in the other, against
COMOVEMENT_STATIC_PX = 5. Above the bar the cart reads "moving" beside a static
person, which is the bystander branch of are_co_moving(), so that frame
contributed no evidence to the link. The candidate reached 19 frames against
the contested bar of 20, then hit a barren gap and lost all 19 to
LINK_CANDIDATE_PATIENCE. The link was established at frame 181 instead of 167,
and the two builds disagreed on 14 frames of output.

Nothing about that was version-specific — any run-to-run float wobble can
straddle a bar a track happens to be sitting on. StaticLatch gives the call
hysteresis so a track hovering at the bar keeps its state.

Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches the rest of the repo.
