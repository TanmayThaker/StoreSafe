"""Every finalised event row must be reproducible from its own fields.

ONE ASSERTION CATCHES A WHOLE CLASS
-----------------------------------
An event row carries a score AND the inputs that score was computed from. So:

    compute_pops(row.direction, row.speed_status, True, row.fill, row.bag,
                 abandoned=row.abandoned, linked=row.linked) == row.pops_score

Any row that fails this describes a cart that never existed. Both golden clips
were shipping one before this test was written, and neither was visible in any
count or ID:

  * PUSHOUT ALERT | 75 | OUTBOUND | SLOW | abandoned=false — 75 came from a live
    frame where the cart WAS abandoned; sync_events_with_snapshots() rewrote the
    score from the reconciled snapshot and left the flag at the live row's value.
    Recomputing from the row's own fields gives 55.
  * MEDIUM PRIORITY | 45 | OUTBOUND | MEDIUM — 45 requires STATIC; MEDIUM gives 60.

Both are the same bug: a score taken from one moment beside a context taken from
another. The fix is that the sync rewrites every input it rewrites the score
from. This test is what keeps it fixed, and it needs no video to run.

The second half pins the tier rule: a loggable NAME is not enough, because
classify_event() returns "UNLINKED EXIT" from two different tiers.
