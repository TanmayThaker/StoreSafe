"""The rule badges have to survive the round trip onto the annotated video.

Run with:  python tests/test_rule_overlay_video.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Operational rule findings are post-hoc: no frame in the tracking loop can know
that a cart is about to stand in the doorway long enough to matter, so the
badges cannot be drawn while the AVI is being written. They are painted on a
second pass, during the encode that was already happening
(`video_io.reencode_to_mp4(avi_path, frame_hook=...)`).

That pass is the piece most likely to fail quietly. `_process_video` swallows an
encode exception on purpose — a broken encoder must not throw away a good run —
so a mistake here does not raise anywhere the user can see it. It empties the
video panel instead. Hence a real ffmpeg round trip rather than a stub:

  * every frame of the AVI reaches the encoder (a dropped frame shortens the
    clip and desynchronises it from the event log's timestamps),
  * the hook is called with the SAME 1-based numbering the tracking loop used,
    which is what makes `rules.overlay_index()`'s frame keys mean anything,
  * a hook that raises fails loudly rather than producing a silently unbadged
    video.

Needs ffmpeg — imageio_ffmpeg ships it, and the app cannot start without it.
Deliberately stdlib only, no pytest — matches the rest of the repo.
