"""Start the POPS demo: check the checkout, build the environment if needed,
open the UI.

    python run_demo.py
    python run_demo.py --check-only   # everything except opening the demo
    python run_demo.py --no-model     # do not pre-download the case-report model

Safe to run repeatedly. The environment is only built the first time; after
that this takes a couple of seconds to verify and then launches.

On Windows, double-clicking run_demo.bat calls this — that wrapper exists to
find (or download) a Python 3.12 first, so a machine with no Python, or the
wrong Python, still works. This file assumes it already has a usable one.

The three things that go wrong on someone else's machine, all checked here
before anything slow starts:

  * git-lfs was not installed, so the model weights are 130-byte pointer files
    and the demo would die at model load with an unreadable torch error.
  * sample_videos/ is empty, so the dropdown has nothing in it. Not fatal —
    you can drag a video into the UI — but worth saying before the browser
    opens rather than after.
  * the virtual environment is missing or half-built.
  * the local case-report model is not in the Hugging Face cache. It is a 4 GB
    download that otherwise happens the first time someone clicks Run
    Analysis, silently, while the case-report tab appears to hang. Better to
    pay for it during setup, where the wait is expected and visible.

No environment variables are required. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is read only if you
pick a Claude backend in the UI instead of the local model, and the UI has a
box for the key anyway. The STORESAFE_* variables in app_poc_v2.py are debugging
switches that default to off.
