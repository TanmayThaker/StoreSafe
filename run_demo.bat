rem  POPS demo - double-click this file.
rem
rem  It needs nothing installed beforehand. In order, it looks for:
rem    1. an environment a previous run already built  (instant)
rem    2. a Python 3.12 or 3.11 already on this machine
rem    3. uv, which downloads a private Python 3.12 that touches nothing else
rem       (and installs uv itself, into your user folder, if it is missing)
rem
rem  Then it hands over to run_demo.py, which builds the environment if
rem  needed and opens the demo in your browser.
rem
rem  The first run downloads several GB and can take 10-20 minutes. Later runs
rem  start in seconds. An internet connection is required the first time.
