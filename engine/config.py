LINK_DRIFT_IOU = 0.05
STALE_CART_FRAMES   = 30      # purge link after cart absent this many frames

#: Minimum IoU for a person to be considered a candidate owner at all. Only
#: rejects grazing contact — a foreground body clipping the corner of a
#: background cart's box scored 0.05 and won a link on the 1764099569430 clip.
#: Deliberately NOT raised to 0.10: that cart's REAL handler dipped to 0.098, so

#: Ground-plane sanity for candidate owners, as a multiple of the CART's own

#:
#:     foot_ratio = (person_y2 - cart_y2) / cart_height
#:
#: Positive means the person's feet land in front of the cart's base — nearer the
#: camera. A person standing with a cart shares its ground plane, so the ratio
#: stays small; a body in the extreme foreground that merely overlaps a distant
#: cart in 2D does not.
#:
#: Compared against the MEAN over a candidate's whole window, never per frame.
#: Per-frame the pusher is legitimately nearer the camera than their own cart
#: whenever the cart is being pushed away from it: on the primary golden clip the
#: correct P1->C1 link exceeds this bar on 39% of its frames while averaging
#: +0.19. Measured with tests/sweep_link_geometry.py over every link both golden
#: clips make, the mean separates cleanly — worst legitimate +0.36, best mislink
#: +0.64 — and 0.45 sits in that gap at 0.80x the worst legitimate reading and
#: 1.42x the best mislink.
LINK_GROUND_BAND = 0.45

#: The other end of the same test: a mean below this means the person's box ends
#: above the CART'S TOP across the whole window, i.e. they are behind it in depth.
#: Weaker than the foreground bound — the legitimate P2->C1 pair on the primary
#: clip means -0.87, only 1.15x clear — so it exists to catch the gross case, and
#: a candidate near it should be treated as unproven rather than wrong.
LINK_BEHIND_BAND = -1.0

#: How far a cart's centroid must have wandered — measured as the diagonal of
#: the box its positions have swept, not net displacement — before it counts as
#: having MOVED. Below this it is parked: store furniture, a staging corral, a

#:
#: 12px matches RULE_STATIC_POS_SPREAD_PX, which answers the same question for

#: apart: this one gates linking, that one gates dwell reporting.
LINK_STATIC_SPREAD_PX = 12.0

#: Frames of observation before "it has not moved" is allowed to mean anything.
#:
#: A cart that has only just appeared has not moved either, and treating that as
#: parked would apply the parked-cart rules to every cart in its first second —
#: including a shopper pulling one out of the corral, whose cart is genuinely
#: motionless right up to the moment they take it. 40 frames is 2s at 20fps.
#:
#: Read from the point the measurement window opens (first sighting, or the frame
#: the cart's current link was established), not from the cart's first frame.
LINK_STATIC_MIN_FRAMES = 40

#: IoU a person must reach before a PARKED cart's co-movement exemption applies
#: to them.
#:
#: are_co_moving(static_a_ok=True) exists so that "cart standing still, person
#: moving around it" reads as loading or unloading rather than as evidence
#: against ownership. That case is a person AT the cart: on the 1764099569430
#: clip the handler it was written for held IoU 0.24-0.42. Granting the same
#: exemption to grazing contact is what let a shopper walking past a parked cart
#: on the 1764200318790 clip take ownership of it with 6 frames of corner overlap
#: at IoU 0.039-0.064 — and, the cart never having moved since, keep it for the
#: remaining 279 frames of the run.
#:
#: Below this bar a moving person and a parked cart are simply not co-moving, and
#: the candidate is rejected as it was before the exemption existed. Both-static
#: is a separate branch of are_co_moving() and is unaffected: a person standing
#: at a parked cart still accumulates, and LINK_STATIC_MIN_FRAMES/
#: LINK_STATIC_SPREAD_PX raise their bar to LINK_CONTESTED_FRAMES instead.
LINK_STATIC_MIN_IOU = 0.15

#: Peak IoU a link must have reached, at any point in its life, before it counts
#: as real POSSESSION rather than contact the geometry happened to allow.
#:
#: Read only by the parked-cart release in linker.py, and only to decide whether
#: to report the cart DISOWNED. A release always happens; disownment is the
#: stronger claim that the link was never real, and it makes the tracker forget
#: the remembered owner — which closes the abandonment route for the rest of the
#: run, because a cart with no owner cannot be abandoned by anyone.
#:
#: The two clips this is calibrated on:
#:   * 1764200318790: shopper grazes a parked cart, peak IoU 0.064 over six
#:     frames. Never real. Disownment is right, and the whole reason that branch
#:     exists.
#:   * FF1763940475070 Cart 2: owner P3 holds the cart from frame 28 to 130 at
#:     IoU mean 0.155, peak 0.363, then steps away; the cart has not moved, so
#:     the parked branch fired and disowned it. P3 left frame at 164 with the
#:     cart still loaded and unbagged, and with no remembered owner `abandoned`
#:     stayed False for all 412 frames — 75 HIGH PRIORITY where the run had
#:     been a PUSHOUT ALERT.
#:
#: A PEAK rather than a mean: grazing contact has no peak — 0.064 is what the
#: 1764200318790 crossing reaches at its closest — while a long real link is
#: diluted by every frame the owner stands off to the side, which is most of
#: them. The two cases separate by 5.6x on peak and by 2.4x on mean.
#:
#: Numerically equal to LINK_STATIC_MIN_IOU today and calibrated on the same
#: clips, but NOT the same quantity: that one gates one frame's co-movement
#: evidence for a candidate, this one judges a whole established link. They are
#: free to be retuned apart.
#:
#: The peak is measured over the CANDIDATE window as well as the link itself —
#: see linker.py, where the link seeds it with max(this frame, candidate peak).
#: Do not compensate for a missed case by lowering this number: the third clip
#: it is calibrated on, 1764029361010, formed its link at IoU 0.1388 and would
#: need 0.13 to pass on the formation frame alone, which is inside the grazing
#: band above. Its real contact, 0.3139, is in the candidacy window.

ABANDON_FRAMES      = 30      # person gone N frames → abandonment

#: How far the owner has to be from their cart before the walkaway branch of
#: abandonment starts counting, measured as the shortest distance between the
#: two BOUNDING BOXES (zero when they touch or overlap) as a fraction of the
#: cart box's diagonal.
#:
#: This replaced a flat `WALKAWAY_DIST_THRESH = 200` px measured centroid to
#: centroid, which called a cart abandoned while its owner was standing against
#: it. On the 1764173272870 static-cart clip Cart 1 was scored 65 ABANDONED CART
#: with Person 4 in contact with the cart for the whole run: the two boxes
#: touched (edge gap 0.0 px, IoU 0.035) but the cart is large and seen from
#: above, so their centroids sat 232 px apart — past the 200 px bar on every
#: frame. Two properties of a centroid distance caused that and neither is
#: fixable by moving the bar: it grows with the size of the box, so a big cart
#: reads as "far" from anyone standing beside it rather than in front of it, and
#: it is an absolute pixel count, so the same physical distance means different
#: things at the top and bottom of a perspective view.
#:

#
#: How close a person has to be for the cart to read as ATTENDED, measured
#: centroid to centroid as a fraction of the cart box's diagonal.
#:
#: This replaced a flat RULE_ATTENDED_RADIUS_PX = 220 px. A pixel count means a
#: different floor distance at every depth: across the trajectory cache the
#: median cart box diagonal is ~237 px (p10 120, p90 316), so 220 px is roughly
#: arm's reach for a cart at the front of frame and most of the room for one at
#: the far door. On the 1764197283870 static-cart clip that is what kept Cart 2
#: silent — parked alone in the entrance vestibule for the whole clip, box
#: diagonal 202 px, with the nearest person's centroid a median 156 px away, so
#: 76% of its samples read as attended and the longest unattended window was
#: 3.5s. Scaling by the cart's own apparent size is the same depth proxy
#: WALKAWAY_GAP_FRAC uses, and it leaves a large near cart at roughly the old
#: behaviour (implied bar p90 221 px) while tightening small far ones (p10 84).

# their own path, netting a delta under DIRECTION_MIN_DY. That reads as
# UNKNOWN, which loses the OUTBOUND base score and the fill/bag terms with it:
# a full unbagged cart walking out scores 70 as OUTBOUND and 25 as UNKNOWN, and
# 25 is under the 31 that gets an event logged at all.
#
# Seconds rather than a sample count on purpose: positions are appended per
# DETECTION, so "the last 40 samples" is 2s for a cleanly tracked cart and 30s
# for a sparsely detected one. Same index-as-time confusion the rule engine's

# a cart that reaches the door and stops loses its heading as soon as the
# DIRECTION_WINDOW_S window empties of the approach, and the UNKNOWN branch of
# compute_pops() then caps an abandoned loaded cart at 65 instead of 75.
#
# ~1s at the 19-20 fps these clips run at. Not a formality: DIRECTION_MIN_DY is
# 20px, so one twitch of the trailing window can resolve OUTBOUND on a cart
# parked inside the store, and latching that would promote a shopper who parks
# at a shelf and steps away from ABANDONED CART to PUSHOUT ALERT.

#: ON at 40 px. Sized against the case it exists for: on the 1763950636750
#: OUTSIDE clip Cart 1 holds OUTBOUND for frames 10-84 (+66 px of dy), then
#: settles about 25 px back inside the doorway. DIRECTION_MIN_DY is 20, so that
#: settle resolves INBOUND for 20 frames and used to clear the latch outright,
#: leaving the cart UNKNOWN for its last 267 frames and capping it at the
#: UNKNOWN branch's 65 instead of MERCH_REMOVED_FLOOR's 75. 40 clears the
#: settle with room and is far under a real reversal — a staff member wheeling
#: a cart back inside retreats hundreds of px. Every INBOUND frame of that
#: retreat still scores the kill switch as it always did, because resolve()
#: RETURNS INBOUND either way and only the latch is withheld; what the bar
#: delays is the UNKNOWN frames interleaved with them, which keep reading
#: OUTBOUND until the cart has gone 40px back. That is a handful of frames at
#: the start of a real retrieval, and the cart is attended throughout them.
#:
#: Flat pixels, not a fraction of the cart's box: DirectionLatch takes one
#: scalar for every cart, and a perspective-scaled bar (the shape
#: WALKAWAY_GAP_FRAC uses) would have to be passed per call. Worth doing if a
#: clip ever lands where 40 is wrong at one end of the frame; nothing measured
#: needs it yet.
#:
#: Turning this on moved a GOLDEN clip: 1764099569430 OUTSIDE Cart 1 finalises
#: OUTBOUND instead of UNKNOWN — the same 75 PUSHOUT ALERT either way, because
