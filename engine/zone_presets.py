"""
On-disk zone presets: save the polygons drawn for a clip, load them back the
next time that clip is selected, delete the ones that are no longer wanted.

Gradio-free for the same reason `zone_editor.py` is - the UI layer only
shuttles paths and `Zone` lists between `gr.State` and these functions, so the
file format and the reload rules are unit-testable on their own.

One JSON file per preset, named ``<video stem>__<label>__<when>.json`` -
the clip, what the set is called, and the local time it was created, so the
folder is readable without opening anything. That also means Save never
overwrites: saving the same name twice keeps both, newest first in the list.
A file records
the frame size it was drawn against because `Zone.polygon` is in source-video
pixel coordinates: reloading a 1080p polygon set onto a 720p re-encode of the
same clip would put every zone in the wrong place, which is worse than
refusing, so a size mismatch is reported instead of silently rescaled.
