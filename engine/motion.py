class DirectionLatch:
    """Holds a cart's last SUSTAINED outbound heading through UNKNOWN frames.

    compute_direction_label() answers "which way has this object moved over the
    last DIRECTION_WINDOW_S seconds", and for a cart that reaches the door and
    stops, the honest answer becomes UNKNOWN the moment that window empties of
    the approach. On the 1763942209000 OUTSIDE clip it happened at frame 169:
    the cart parked at y~290 from frame 105, the trailing 4s delta fell under
    DIRECTION_MIN_DY (17px), and the label read UNKNOWN for the remaining 13s.

    That is not a cosmetic label change. The UNKNOWN branch of compute_pops()
    caps an abandoned loaded cart at 65, so a cart standing outside the door
    full of unbagged merchandise scored ABANDONED CART on every one of those
    frames, while the end-of-run finaliser — which reads direction off the peak
    EVENT, logged at frame 104 while the cart was still moving — reported
    PUSHOUT ALERT. One cart, two directions, and the annotated video and the
    POPS table disagreed for 13 of the clip's 22 seconds. The alert appeared
    for 15 frames: 153-167, the only frames where `abandoned` and OUTBOUND
    overlapped.

    A cart that has stopped has not changed its mind about where it was going,
    so the last resolved heading is held while the label reads UNKNOWN. Three
    rules keep that from becoming a licence to over-score:

      * OUTBOUND only. INBOUND is never latched. It is a kill switch worth
        INBOUND_SCORE (5) before contents, speed or abandonment are looked at,
        so holding it would silence the UNKNOWN abandonment tier for any cart
        that ever rolled inbound — including a cart wheeled in, loaded, and
        left.
      * A RESOLVED label always beats the latch, and a resolved INBOUND clears
        it. That is what keeps a staff member wheeling the cart back inside
        from being scored: their push resolves INBOUND and the score drops to
        the kill switch on the same frame it would have without this class.
      * Latching needs `min_frames` CONSECUTIVE resolved OUTBOUND frames
        (DIRECTION_LATCH_FRAMES). DIRECTION_MIN_DY is 20px, so a single twitch
        of the trailing window can resolve OUTBOUND on a cart parked inside the
        store, and holding that forever would move a shopper who parks at a
        shelf and steps away from 65 (ABANDONED CART) to 75 (PUSHOUT ALERT) —
        precisely the false positive that cap exists to prevent.

    Keyed by whatever the caller passes. tracker.py passes the cart DISPLAY id,
    matching _walkaway_frames and _cart_cls_history, so the latch survives a
    re-ID that hands the same cart a new raw tracker id — the case where the
    position history resets and the heading would be lost anyway.

    Stateful, so it lives here as a class rather than as another argument to
    compute_direction_label(); the label function stays pure.
