HTML generation for the Gradio UI — POPS summary, events timeline,
operational alerts, info tables, the sticky alert banner and the run summary.

fallbacks) rather than hardcoded hex, so the panels follow the light/dark
toggle instead of fighting it. Tables are built by :func:`theme.render_table`,

    answer dressed up as a clean bill of health.

    ``unavailable_reason`` is PARTIAL, though, and that distinction is the

    counted them (it reads ``rule_findings`` directly) while this panel said
    nothing had run. So the caveat now sits ABOVE the findings rather than in
    place of them.

    ``diagnostics`` is the finer-grained version of the same idea and is shown
