"""
Per-object orientation provider for the 2D BEV.

v1 uses *movement heading* as a proxy for body-facing yaw. A stationary
object holds its last non-stationary heading so the rendered box doesn't
flicker back to 0 deg whenever the shopper pauses.

To swap in a real pose-derived body yaw later, replace
`attach_orientations` with a version that reads from a pose channel.
The renderer only consumes the `o` field on each slim-frame object;
no other code changes are required.
