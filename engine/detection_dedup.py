"""Suppress nested duplicate detections that IoU-based NMS structurally cannot.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
The detector routinely emits two boxes for one cart: a tight one around the
basket and a loose one that also swallows the handle, wheels and shadow. NMS
compares them by IoU, and IoU between nested boxes is bounded by their area
ratio — it never approaches 1 no matter how completely one sits inside the
other. Measured on 1764092528600_B8A44F40EFB5-medium-OUTSIDE.mp4:

    frame 141   [671,312,846,523] conf 0.874   (175x211)
                [671,311,777,425] conf 0.609   (106x114)
                IoU 0.323   containment 0.991
    frame 150   IoU 0.512   containment 1.000
    frame 169   IoU 0.434   containment 0.964

With the default `iou=0.7` NMS gate, nothing in that range is ever suppressed.
Both boxes survive, BoTSORT quite correctly tracks two objects, and one physical
cart is reported as two — it picked up display IDs Cart 1 and Cart 3, was scored
twice (POPS 75 "HIGH PRIORITY" and POPS 75 "PUSHOUT ALERT"), and the run summary
claimed 3 carts where there were 2.

Lowering the NMS threshold is not the fix: to catch an IoU of 0.32 you would
have to merge boxes that are genuinely 68% disjoint, which would start eating
adjacent carts in a queue.

THE MEASURE
-----------
Containment — intersection over the area of the SMALLER box, sometimes called
IoMin or Intersection-over-Smaller. It is 1.0 for a perfectly nested pair
regardless of the size difference, which is exactly the case IoU is blind to.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SUPPRESSED
-----------------------------------
Suppression is scoped to a single class. A person standing inside their cart's
bounding box is the normal case in this footage, not a duplicate, and must
survive — as must a cart inside a doorway zone, a bag inside a cart, and so on.

Two carts in a queue, one 90%+ occluded behind the other, WOULD be merged. That
is the accepted cost: a box that far occluded has an unreliable extent anyway,
and reporting one cart twice is the worse failure for loss prevention. The
threshold is a config knob (NESTED_DUP_CONTAIN_MIN) so it can be raised if a
real queue case shows up.

WHERE THIS RUNS
---------------
From RetailBOTSORT.update, on the tracker's input, BEFORE the high/low
confidence pools are split. Filtering there catches a duplicate pair that
straddles the split — one box above track_high_thresh and its twin below —
which per-pool filtering would miss. Suppressing pre-tracker also means no
second track is ever created, so no display ID, POPS row, classification vote,
cart fact or frame-JSON entry is ever written for the duplicate. Merging IDs
after the fact would have to retract all of those.
