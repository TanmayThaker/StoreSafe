"""
Pure "what counts as a highlight" selection logic, shared between the
case-report HTML's Operations Highlights section and the tracking JSON's
`operational_highlights` key, so the two artifacts can never disagree on what
"severe" or "top" means.

Stdlib only, duck-typed via getattr() — same convention engine.ui_builder
uses for RuleFinding/QueueSpike consumers — so this module needs no import
from analytics_models/rules/ui_builder and can be imported from anywhere in
the engine package with zero cycle risk.
