"""
Operational rule engine — turns recorded facts into the four operational
outcomes (blocked door, static cart, unattended cart, incoming empty cart).

Runs POST-HOC over a cached TrajectoryBundle rather than inside the frame loop.
That is deliberate: TrackingEngine.recompute_analytics() exists so that editing
a zone re-runs analytics without re-running YOLO, and evaluating rules in the
live loop would throw that away — every threshold tweak would cost a full GPU
pass. Post-hoc also means whole-timeline visibility, which is what makes
correct interval closing, gap merging, and real duration reporting possible.

Deliberately separate from POPS scoring. `scoring.py` already emits
"ABANDONED CART" as a theft-risk label gated behind pops_score >= 31, and an
INBOUND cart is floored to 5 by the kill switch — so an operational
abandonment routed through compute_pops() would be structurally unreachable.

Pure numpy + stdlib (plus cv2.fillPoly for rasterisation) and STATELESS, so it
stays unit-testable without torch/ultralytics and safe to call from the shared
engine singleton.
