        #     PROGRESS_MAX_UPDATES in tracker.py exists to throttle.

    # A dependency with `fn=None, js=...` is JS-ONLY — the client evaluates it
    # in the browser and never opens a backend submission for it. Gradio's
    # client dispatches a dependency's `.then()` targets only on the SUBMISSION
    # branch, when the SSE stream reaches stage "complete" (see the `u.type`
    # switch in the frontend bundle: the `"data"` and `"void"` branches call
    # neither the `success` nor the `all` trigger list). So a js-only event is a
    # DEAD END for the chain: anything `.then()`-ed after it never runs.
    #
    # Chaining these serially — run → js tab-switch → finalize — meant
    # finalize_case_report_handler was never called at all. Whenever frames were
    # captured, the case-report tab kept the "Generating case report…"
    # placeholder that process_video returns under defer_case_report=True, and
    # kept it indefinitely. Nothing was slow and nothing errored; the second
